Week2:
I thought of doing an app where I can sell the plants by linking all the nurseries in the city.
Week3:
When I found my classmate doing the same project I decided to continue with my second passion idea i.e developing a platform where the art lovers can view the videos of there favourite art products,buy the arts or buy the items required to make it.
Week4:
I started going through some online courses where arts are being taught. After all the analysis I just had a rough design of the project.

I documented all the 3 methods i.e the usecases,user stories,SRS and backlogs.
