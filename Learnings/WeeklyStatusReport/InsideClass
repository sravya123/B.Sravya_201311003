Week1:
.we tried to analyze and even modify the most popular game 'CANDY CRUSH'.
.Most of them started writing the game algorithm.
.The course agenda was so interesting and challenging but I was a little bit worried when I saw the pre-requirements of the course.
.By the end of class I had a question 'What SOFTWARE ENGINEERING actually means?'

Week 2:
.I always start coding without a perfect plan once I get the project but after the class I came to know about different 
systamatic ways of developing the a 'SUCCESSFUL' software.
.Only a partial part of life cycle process of Software engineering went into my mind.
.I learnt two process models(Traditional and Agile Model).Among them I loved Agile Model because I used to follow that.

Week 3:
.I got to know about Requirement Engineering (informal method)and Design Engineering(formal methods).
.Functional and non-funtional requirements of the product.(Discussion about the Phones was exciting). 
.I came to know that there are lot of ways I should learn to document a project before coding it. 

Week 4:
.Got back our confidence about the project when we saw a similar project prototype.
.team project management.

Week 5:
.Enjoyed at lot questioning my team mates by placing myself in different roles. 
.I got many points about my passion project in the discussion with my team members.
.Understood how to document the requirements of different stack holders, step by step process involved in our project
 prototype before coding it(SRS,use cases,user stories). 
 .At the end I understood that implementing would become easier if we document it.
